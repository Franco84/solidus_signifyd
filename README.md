Solidus Signifyd
================

Integration with Signifyd that implements a fraud check prior to marking a
shipment as ready to be shipped.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/solidusio/solidus_signifyd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/solidusio/solidus_signifyd)

* All orders are sent to SIGNIFYD for scoring when they transition to complete.
* Risk analysis is returned from SIGNIFYD via a webhook and added to order.
* Orders with a risk score >= 500 (default review disposition threshhold)
    - Paid orders are marked ready to ship.
* Orders with a risk score < 500
    - Are cancelled.
    - Risk analysis is displayed in admin.

Installation
------------

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "solidus_signifyd"
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_signifyd:install
```

Create a SIGNIFYD test team within the SIGNIFYD account. The API key is listed on the Teams page after a team has been created.

Create SIGNIFYD notifications for each event type and provide your
`api_spree_signifyd_orders_path`. To work with external webhook in local
development you may need to change the rails server [default host] and enable
port forwarding or setup a reverse SSH tunnel.

```
http://www.example.com/api/spree_signifyd/orders
```

Cases can be inspected in the SIGNIFYD web console.

### Risky Orders

Flagging a case as bad in the SIGNIFYD web console will associate
a fraudulent case with the order's email. This will cause future orders to drop
below the `reviewDisposition` threshhold of 500 and allow you to inspect a
risky order.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to
building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy
app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle exec rake
```
